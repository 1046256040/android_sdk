## Build adjust using Maven

We started using Google Play Services to obtain the advertising ID if the user didnâ€™t opt out.
Because this library is not present in the Maven public repository it's necessary to import it manually.

Add the following command to your maven install build.
```
mvn install:install-file \
-DgroupId=com.google.android.gms \
-DartifactId=google-play-services \
-Dversion=4.3.23 \
-Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=libs/google-play-services.jar
```
